# Notes on Project Structure:
  Useable main scripts:
	- realtimeRunner.py, used in conjunction with task scheduler (crontab)
	- batchRunner.py, used to fetch historical data
	- runAllConfigSymbolsBatch.py, used to run batchRunner for all symbols in config.json 

  Config:
	- .env should be filled with required vars before use
	- config.py for some settings not fitting in .env 
		- logs_folder: defaults to user home, can be modified
	- config.json: Stores important data relating to which symbols to fetch (and
	    which resolutions to fetch at)

# Misc Notes
  config.py should be import before other custom modules in main script(s)

  finnHub has a maximum of 60 request / min, this needs to be taken into account when 
  	trying to run multiple resolutions together realtime with large amounts of symbols

	Ex. If only running with resolution of 1, up to 60 symbols can be fetched per minute

    If only wanting to fetch historical data, simply using batchRunner should be no problem for
	large amounts of symbols

  NOTE: When calling batchRunner you can insert duplicate data into your tables.
	No safeguard has been added (yet) to ensure no duplication

  # Notifications:

    SMS and Email notifications are set:
      Email at the end of every day to notify completion, attached with logs of the day's work
      SMS whenever there is an error for quick notification.

    Changing email to run after job finished seems a bit much, but can easily add
     crontab task to accomplish this

# CRONTAB

  "Main" files are meant to be run with crontab

  crontab -e

  Needs to be edited manually with above command, in accordance to each timeframe rule

Example crontab used for assignment below:
