# Visualization Assignment 2

For personal user: 

Please comment the following from the third code chunk:

(The default API_KEY is loaded from environment variable)

```
from etl_utils.etl_config import FINNHUB_CONFIG
```

 and then reassign `API_token` to your own key:

```
API_token = FINNHUB_CONFIG["API_KEY"] # Set your own API_key here as string
```
